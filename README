This plugin highlights words that do not belong to the language in c,cpp and java-buffers.  This way you can instantly see if you have typed the right variable/package/class name right.

I just did this to say: "Hey look, my vim is as good as your eclipse!" :)

This is my first plugin and also my first submission, so please, bear with me.
